Monotouch bindings for the Localytics iOS SDK
===========================================

- Run make to build the v2.16 version of Localytics and compile the bindings.
- Add the monotouch-localytics.dll to your project references and start tracking analytics.

NOTE: The static library that is created has been built for the i386, armv7, armv7s architectures and will work on both the simulator as well as iOS devices.
